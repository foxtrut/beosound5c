"""Static check of sys.path + import ordering in source services.

Every source service (``sources/<name>/service.py``) runs as a standalone
script under systemd, so its only initial ``sys.path[0]`` is the script's
own directory.  The service's top-level code then does two things:

    sys.path.insert(0, <services/>)                 # make ``lib`` importable
    sys.path.insert(0, <this directory>)            # make siblings importable
    from <sibling>_auth import ...                  # needs both
    from lib.config import cfg                      # needs services/

The bug this test catches: if the ``services/`` insert happens *after*
the sibling import, and that sibling transitively imports from ``lib``
(which is what happened when ``*_tokens.py`` moved to the shared
``lib.token_store``), the service fails at startup with
``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lib'``.

We can't easily reproduce this at runtime from pytest because
``conftest.py`` pre-populates ``services/`` on ``sys.path``, hiding
the ordering bug.  Static analysis of each service.py catches it
with zero deploy risk.
